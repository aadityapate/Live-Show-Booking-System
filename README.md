# Live Show Booking System
Live show booking system is a system in which we can book seats of a live show as per the availability of seats.

Functionality:-
1)We can see available seats of a show
2)We can book and cancel seat.

Constraints:-
1) rows and columns for both shows are constant.
2) Only 2 shows added by default.

How it works?
- First choose the show which you want to see.
- Then enter the row and column of a seat (consider 1-based indexing like 11 , 12 etc.) that you want to book.
- After entering the row and column of a seat, the seats will be booked.
- The seat matrix will show 1 for booked seat, 0 for available seat.
- You can also cancel the seat by entering the row and column of a seat.
